# The Signal Clone Project

As always, you are welcome to use whatever you find here.

- In the setup, I used expo init with the typescript types.

- To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

```
# use one of the following to start:
npm start 
expo start
# You can open iOS, Android, or web directly with the commands below. Notice you may need to use expoGo application or your device or use a simulator.
npm/expo run android
npm/expo run ios
npm/expo run web
```
